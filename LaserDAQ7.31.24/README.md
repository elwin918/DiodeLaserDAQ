enter the following command
    python main.py
This will take you to the GUI

on the GUI, select your sampling rate and power factors and click save then start
    enter 1 as the com port in the terminal if asked

the Teensy should now add the data to the file "data.csv" 

if you want to make a new csv file, just change the name of data.csv

    the data.csv file will reset the next time you run main.py  -->
